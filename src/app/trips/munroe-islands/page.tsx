          <p className="text-1g-gray-400 mb-8">
            On <strong>26th January 2024</strong>, we embarked on a memorable
            one-day trip from Trivandrum to the breathtaking backwaters of{" "}
            <strong>Ashtamudi Lake</strong> and <strong>Munroe Islands</strong>.
            It was a group of nine of us, full of excitement and anticipation.
            We set off around <strong>9:30 AM</strong> in{" "}
            <strong>two vehicles</strong>, ready for the journey ahead.

          <p className="text-gray-400 mb-8">
            By <strong>11:30 AM</strong>, we arrived at the{" "}
            <strong>Kollam bus stand</strong>, opposite which lay the{" "}
            <strong>Kollam boat jetty</strong>. Although we were running late,
            the boat awaited us at the harbor, ready for our adventure.

            We were greeted with a refreshing <strong>welcome drink</strong>,

          <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Stories of Ashtamudi</h3>
          <p className="text-gray-400 mb-8">
            While cruising, the crew shared fascinating tales about the region,
            its traditions, and the lives of people dependent on the lake. A
            sight that caught our attention was a{" "}
            <strong>bridge abruptly ending in the middle of the lake</strong>, a
            project interrupted midway.

          <p className="text-gray-400 mb-8">
            We also passed an <strong>island hosting a vibrant party</strong>,
            adorned with decorations.

          <p className="text-gray-400 mb-8">
            Another notable landmark was the magnificent{" "}

            by the serene waters.

            The crew served us a local delicacy of{" "}

              kappa (tapioca) and puzhameen curry (lake fish curry)
            </strong>

          <p className="text-gray-400 mb-8">
            While dining, we noticed people standing in shallow waters in the
            middle of the lake, and soon, we had the chance to do the same.

            We stopped at a <strong>kadavu (dock)</strong> to grab snacks and
            caps for the next adventureâ€”a small boat ride into the{" "}
            <strong>mangrove forests</strong>. This boat was so close to the
            water that we could dip our hands in it.

          <p className="text-gray-400 mb-8">
            As we cruised along, we saw several <strong>houseboats</strong>,

          <p className="text-gray-400 mb-8">
            We also spotted a <strong>thonikaaran (boatman)</strong> and a
            majestic <strong>crane skimming the water&apos;s surface</strong>,
            hunting for fish.

            Farewell to the Backwaters
          </h3>
          <p className="text-gray-400 mb-8">
            After a delicious lunch on the boat, we started our journey back,
            soaking in the beauty of the landscapes one last time. As the boat
            docked back at the jetty, we carried home not just memories but a
            profound sense of tranquility from the serene backwaters of
            Ashtamudi.
